# To Do:

* 2015-12-29: [command line exercises](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/03/15-practical-unix-grep-command-examples/)
* 2015-12-29: make a [much better prompt](https://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/772396-how-to-make-a-fancy-and-useful-bash-prompt-in-linux-)
* 2015-12-29: learn [bash commands](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) all the commands I told you to study are described and explained.

## PB Adds:
- 2015-12-30 check out the new *done* [feature](https://github.com/blog/1375%0A-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments) in github markdown. do you like it?
- 2015-12-30 do [another git tutorial](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) I like the style.
- 2015-12-30 consider [this format](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/the-todo.txt-format). it's well-tested, has lots of other tools to work with it. it uses priorities (listed as (A), (B), or (C)), projects (like +ibmtest, +commandstudy), and context (@laptop, @mom).

# Done
* 2015-12-30/2015-12-30: Make task list in Markdown for GitHub
